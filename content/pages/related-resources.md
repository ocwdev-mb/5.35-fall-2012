[Digital Laboratory Techniques Manual](/courses/res-5-0001-digital-lab-techniques-manual-spring-2007)

The "Digital Lab Techniques Manual" is a series of videos designed to help you prepare for your chemistry laboratory class. Each video provides a detailed demonstration of a common laboratory technique, as well as helpful tips and information.

Video 1. [Volumetric Techniques](/courses/res-5-0001-digital-lab-techniques-manual-spring-2007/resources/volumetric-techniques): This video introduces the proper methods for measuring precise volumes of liquid using pipets, burets, volumetric flasks, and syringes.

Video 7. [Filtration](/courses/res-5-0001-digital-lab-techniques-manual-spring-2007/resources/filtration): Learn how to effectively carry out gravity and vacuum filtrations in this video.

Video 11. [Balances](/courses/res-5-0001-digital-lab-techniques-manual-spring-2007/resources/using-a-balance): Correct usage and maintenance of a balance is a basic skill that is essential in any laboratory procedure.
